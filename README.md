# Restaurant Price Prediction System
This project predicts the average cost for two at restaurants based on features such as location, category, and rating. It uses a trained machine learning model and is integrated into a web interface (originally built using Flask but adaptable to PHP or any backend framework). Users can input restaurant attributes and instantly get a price prediction.
